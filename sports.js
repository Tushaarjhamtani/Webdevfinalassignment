    Sports can help one develop a work ethic and a mental toughness, both of which can be useful in later life. Sports can offer repeated opportunities for one to practice and improve the skills of self-discipline and self-control. Sports participation  can set the stage for a life of physical fitness.
    <br />So we have a football and basketball available for rent.
